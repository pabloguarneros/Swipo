## Problem 
Current youth disengagement from actively contributing to social projects within their local community

## Proposal
Tinder-esque alternative to pair youth to local problems they want to solve.

1) Way for youth to connect and build momentum
2) Way for administrators at schools or local governments to see what are the most pressing problems students are swiping right
